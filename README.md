# LeNet-Based Image Classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10

This repository contains two well-documented Jupyter notebooks implementing the **LeNet-5 convolutional neural network architecture** using **TensorFlow/Keras** for:

- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit classification
- **CIFAR-10**: Object classification across 10 categories (e.g., airplane, cat, ship)

These projects demonstrate model design, training workflows, and evaluation methods on datasets of increasing complexity.

**Problem:** Understanding CNN fundamentals is essential before tackling complex medical imaging tasks.  
**Solution:** Implemented LeNet-5 from scratch in TensorFlow/Keras for MNIST (digits) and CIFAR-10 (objects).  
**Outcome:** Achieved >98% accuracy on MNIST and ~60% on CIFAR-10, demonstrating model adaptability from simple to complex datasets.
